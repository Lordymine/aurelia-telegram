status_reason: 'All 10 ACs fully implemented and tested. Auth middleware correctly checks telegram_id whitelist on every message. Command handlers (/start, /help, /status) provide useful operational info. Echo handler is clean placeholder for Kimi. 20 new tests (97 total) cover middleware, handlers, and bot factory. Security review passed — no PII/tokens logged.'
